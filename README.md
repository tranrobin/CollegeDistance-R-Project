This paper constructs statistical models to identify two main problems of interest, using the CollegeDistance dataset which first appeared in Rouse C.E’s journal (1995) on the effects of community colleges on educational attainment. In their journal, Rouse discussed the effect of college access on the educational achievement of an individual, by analyzing data collected about members of the high school senior class in different areas. In this paper, the focus will be on how an individual’s background can affect their education level, considering factors such as distance from home to the nearest 4-year college, ethnicity, and family income.
